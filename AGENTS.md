## StepTronOSS AGENTS

This file stores repo-specific priors for future agents. Keep it short, practical,
and biased toward things that save repeated exploration.

## 1. Working Rules

### Self-Improvement Loop

Do an improve pass for key tasks:

- new environment
- new task type
- new project area
- high risk / high cost work
- collaboration / handoff work

Improve pass:

1. Identify friction
2. Extract reusable priors
3. Write them down in:
   - `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide priors
   - `docs/` for process / runbook details

## 2. Repo Layout

- Core package: `steptronoss/`
  - core, model, data, exp, optimizer, generation, tokenizer, utils, checkpointing
- Experiments: `playground/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Docs: `docs/`

### Utilities overview

- `steptronoss/utils/arguments.py`: config overrides from CLI
- `steptronoss/utils/comm_utils.py`: Redis rendezvous, queues, `LocalFuture` / `RemoteFuture`
- `steptronoss/utils/dist_utils.py`: broadcast / all-to-all helpers, packing helpers, balancing helpers
- `steptronoss/utils/general.py`: numeric helpers, list split/balance, RNG fork, retry, recursion helpers, git hash
- `steptronoss/utils/logger.py`: rank-aware logging and `StepWriter`
- `steptronoss/utils/metrics.py`: metrics system (`Metric`, `Avg`, `Percentage`, `Histogram`, `Text`, `GradNorm`, `GlobalMetrics`)
- `steptronoss/utils/optimizable.py`: `@optimizable(...)` and `set_optimization(...)`
- `steptronoss/utils/utils.py`: model unwrap, param norms, memory report, layer map, IO helpers, generic load
- `steptronoss/utils/weight_loader.py`: HF safetensors mapping / merge

## 3. Code Style

### Config style

- Config class fields should include a short triple-quoted docstring immediately after the attribute definition.
- Follow the `configurize` pattern:
  - class attrs declare sub-config types
  - instance `__init__` sets concrete values
  - use `Ref("..path")` for cross-node linkage
  - configs expose `build()` / `build_*`, `sanity_check()`, `to_dict()`
- Only `Ref(...)` the exact parameter needed, not whole config objects.

### Experiment style

- SFT experiments under `playground/sft/qwen3/*_sft_step3_data.py` typically follow:
  - `class Exp(BaseExp)`
  - `model_cfg` / `data_cfg` declared as class attrs
  - trainer / checkpoint / model fields adjusted in `__init__`
  - entrypoint is `if __name__ == "__main__": Exp().train()`

## 4. Setup Priors

- After `uv sync`, also install `redis-server`:
  - `apt install -y redis-server`

### DeepEP build

- Set:
  - `CUDA_HOME=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda`
  - `CUDACXX=$CUDA_HOME/bin/nvcc`
- Install:
  - `pip install -e /data/DeepEP --no-build-isolation`

### nv-grouped-gemm build

- Do not rely on random prebuilt wheels; ABI mismatch is common.
- Build with CUDA 12.9:
  - `CUDA_HOME=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda CUDACXX=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda/bin/nvcc <python> -m pip install -e <grouped_gemm_source> --no-build-isolation`
- Runtime constraints:
  - `batch_sizes` must be CPU-visible / `torch.int64`
  - inputs must be bf16 for `nv_grouped_gemm`

## 3. Code Style

### Config style

- Config class fields should include a short triple-quoted docstring immediately after the attribute definition.
- Follow the `configurize` pattern:
  - class attrs declare sub-config types
  - instance `__init__` sets concrete values
  - use `Ref("..path")` for cross-node linkage
  - configs expose `build()` / `build_*`, `sanity_check()`, `to_dict()`
- Only `Ref(...)` the exact parameter needed, not whole config objects.

### Experiment style

- SFT experiments under `playground/sft/qwen3/*_sft_step3_data.py` typically follow:
  - `class Exp(BaseExp)`
  - `model_cfg` / `data_cfg` declared as class attrs
  - trainer / checkpoint / model fields adjusted in `__init__`
  - entrypoint is `if __name__ == "__main__": Exp().train()`
- `playground/sft/qwen3/qwen3_sft_base.py` already provides `OneNodeResourceConfig` with `replica=1` and `gpu=8`, so derived SFT experiments default to single-node 8-GPU `torchrun` unless they override `resource_cfg`.
- Under `playground/data/sft`, keep raw source recipes and dataset configs distinct in naming:
  - `*_recipe*.py` for `DataRecipe` / source file lists only
  - `*_data_config*.py` for `CompliableDatasetsConfig`, `CompiledDatasetsConfig`, and `SFTDataConfig`
  - when adding tokenizer variants for the same source recipe, share a common base config and use thin tokenizer-specific subclasses instead of duplicating whole modules
  - for large unified SFT rebuilds, do not mutate source json/jsonl in place; materialize derived json under `/oss/...`, preserve `DataSourceFile.subsample_rate` semantics with sample seed `1234`, and do global shuffle with an external bucketized sort instead of loading everything into memory

## 4. Setup Priors

- After `uv sync`, also install `redis-server`:
  - `apt install -y redis-server`

### DeepEP build

- Set:
  - `CUDA_HOME=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda`
  - `CUDACXX=$CUDA_HOME/bin/nvcc`
- Install:
  - `pip install -e /data/DeepEP --no-build-isolation`

### nv-grouped-gemm build

- Do not rely on random prebuilt wheels; ABI mismatch is common.
- Build with CUDA 12.9:
  - `CUDA_HOME=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda CUDACXX=/data/cuda/cuda-12.9/cuda/bin/nvcc <python> -m pip install -e <grouped_gemm_source> --no-build-isolation`
- Runtime constraints:
  - `batch_sizes` must be CPU-visible / `torch.int64`
  - inputs must be bf16 for `nv_grouped_gemm`

## 5. Experiments and Configs

### Config/module map

- `steptronoss/exp` provides abstract `*Config` interfaces (`build_*`, `get_trainer_cls`)
- Concrete configs live mainly in `steptronoss/exp/base_exp.py`
- Ready-made experiment families:
  - `PretrainExp` / `NTPTrainerConfig` in `ntp.py`
  - `SFTExp` / `SFTDataConfig` in `sft.py`
  - inference configs in `inference.py`
- Common training configs:
  - `AdamConfig`
  - constant / linear / cosine schedulers
  - checkpoint config (`SaveOptions`, `LoadOptions`, `CheckpointConfig`)

### Experiment workflow

- After creating or editing an experiment:
  - run `cfshow <exp.py>` to inspect the config tree
  - make sure `sanity_check()` passes
  - run `mypy <exp.py>`
- If experiment B is derived from experiment A, use `cfshow` diff to verify changes.

### Pretrain config notes

- Pretrain configs live under `playground/pretrain/`
- `playground/pretrain/step3p5/step3p5_flash.py` is the main recent Qwen3 config reference
- When translating a full `ModelConfig` into `step3p5_flash.py`, update only existing attrs
- Some keys map indirectly:
  - `disable_qk_norm` ↔ `use_qk_norm` (inverted)
  - `use_swiglu_limit` ↔ `swiglu_limit`
- For `ImageForInsert` multimodal embeddings with context parallel, do image insertion on the full embedding sequence first and only then call `scatter_to_balanced_cp_region(...)`; scattering `input_ids` before multimodal tok-embedding breaks insert-location alignment.
- For `step3p5v`-style multimodal embeddings, run the vision encoder under `with PM.use_mesh(cfg.encoder_cfg.parallel_cfg): ...` so encoder-side TP/PP settings stay local and the outer language mesh is restored afterward.
- `steptronoss/model/common/vit.py` is now a TP-sharded vision transformer: qkv / out projection and MLP use TP-partitioned linear layers, while patch embedding and downsamplers stay replicated.
- In the current OSS `step3p5v` design, `ImageInsertInputEmbedding` is feature-only; raw `images` are encoded in `Step3p5vModel.forward()` via `MeshConnector(src_mesh, dst_mesh)` before the normal decoder forward runs.
- If you change `num_layers`, keep all layer-wise lists in sync:
  - `qk_rope_head_dim`
  - `rope_theta`
  - `use_fused_qknorm_and_rope`
  - `use_swiglu_limit`
  - `use_swiglu_limit_shared`

### Eval experiment pattern

- `playground/eval/*` currently uses a thin `GenableEvalConfig` wrapper, not the trainer stack.
- The common eval skeleton is three roles in `resource_cfg.task_specs`: `router`, `vllm`, `evaluator`.
- Runtime flow is: `Exp.entrypoint()` dispatch by `ROLE` -> router publishes `VLLM_ROUTER_ADDR_PORT_<key>` in exp Redis -> vLLM worker health-checks then registers -> evaluator waits via `vllm_cfg.build_cli().wait_for_server()` and runs `eval_cfg.eval()`.
- Sample execution path is `GenableEvalConfig.eval()` -> `GenerationController.generate()` -> `SimpleTrainable.generate()` -> router `/v1/completions`; task-specific metrics are computed in the concrete eval config, not in a shared benchmark harness.
- These eval jobs depend on `STEPTRON_MEET_DIR` because `get_exp_redis()` uses the shared filesystem there for Redis rendezvous.
- For a single-node eval, prefer `python tools/mp_run.py playground/eval/...py`; for multi-node/manual scheduling, generate per-role scripts with `python tools/build_scripts.py playground/eval/...py <output_root>`.
- A fresh vLLM 0.17 eval startup can spend several minutes before `/health` opens: model inspection, distributed init, weight load, `torch.compile`, KV-cache sizing, and CUDA graph capture all happen before the controller can register success. Repeated controller-side `Connection refused` during that phase is expected if logs still show forward progress.
- Use `GenableItem` for generation-only eval items and reserve `TrainableItem` for objects that actually implement `generate_for_train()`. `GenerationController` now accepts `GenableItem` on the normal generate path and only requires `TrainableItem` when `for_train=True`.
- The chat eval wraps each `chat/completions` request with `retry_on(...)` for transient HTTP failures. Retry only transport errors and transient statuses (`408`, `425`, `429`, `5xx`); keep permanent `4xx` responses fail-fast so bad requests are not retried blindly.
- `steptronoss/generation/vllm/vllm_router.py` now aims to be timeout-transparent: its upstream `aiohttp` session disables `total/connect/sock_connect/sock_read` timeouts instead of imposing an extra router-side timeout layer. Client-side timeouts still exist, but they are not propagated over HTTP; the closest transparent behavior is for the router not to add its own.
- `GenerationController.set_tqdm(disabled, total, desc)` is the supported way to customize progress output. The callback thread owns the actual tqdm instance; callers should configure it from the main thread instead of constructing ad-hoc bars around controller callbacks.
- In `steptronoss/generation/async_generation.py`, global generation throttling must happen in the main `GenerationController` dispatch path, not by bounding the worker `mp.Queue` alone. Each worker immediately drains that queue into its own local asyncio queue, so a plain queue `maxsize` is not a real global concurrency cap. Use callback/result arrival as the ack that frees one in-flight slot and dispatches the next pending genable.
- In the eval, do not pass raw `max_decode_steps=max_seq_len` straight through to `chat/completions`. Cap each request by `max_model_len - len(prompt.tokens)`; otherwise vLLM rejects every call with `VLLMValidationError` because the prompt leaves zero completion budget.
- `vllm_gpu_memory_utilization=0.95` can make the full mixed-benchmark eval collapse with `EngineDeadError` / `Process EngineCore_DP* died` once generation starts. Lowering the vLLM flag to `0.85` stabilized the default `num_generation_workers=32` subset run (benchmark `down_sample_to=1`) and allowed the full run to start cleanly without immediate OOM spam.
- If you introduce benchmark abstractions on the OSS side, keep the base protocol under `steptronoss/generation/base_benchmark.py`, and put concrete benchmark implementations under `playground/eval/benchmarks/<BenchmarkName>/`. Avoid hiding benchmark selection behind a registry when the benchmark set is still evolving quickly; explicit construction in the eval exp is easier to audit and refactor.
- Shared simple-benchmark eval plumbing now lives in `playground/eval/eval_sets/simple_eval.py`. That module owns the simple-benchmark list itself; model-specific eval files should only bind model/resource/tokenizer config on top of `SimpleBenchmarksEvalConfig`.
- Some Step3/Step3.5 training exports under `/oss/checkpoints/.../hf` contain only safetensor shards plus `model.safetensors.index.json`, without `config.json` or tokenizer assets. Those raw dirs are not directly serveable by vLLM; prepare a wrapper HF dir (for example `hf_vllm`) that adds a compatible `config.json`, and point `tokenizer_path` at a separate mounted tokenizer.
- Sampling policy for the shared simple-benchmark eval should live in `SimpleBenchmarksEvalConfig.get_sampling_params(...)`, not be hardcoded inside `SimpleChatGeneratable`. Keep the generatable responsible only for per-request normalization such as context-budget clamping and filling a default seed when the config leaves it unset.
- Benchmark-focused tests under `tests/` should live in `tests/benchmarks/` instead of the top-level `tests/` directory, so benchmark wrappers and their fixtures stay grouped together.
- Benchmark-specific code should stay inside its own benchmark folder under `playground/eval/benchmarks/<BenchmarkName>/`; avoid spreading benchmark logic, helper modules, or downloaded benchmark assets into unrelated directories.
- Benchmark class initialization must stay lightweight. Prefer lazy import, lazy data parsing, and lazy verifier/resource setup; importing a benchmark module or constructing the benchmark object should not trigger heavyweight package imports, network access, or resource downloads.
- Benchmark resources should live under one explicit root path agreed for that benchmark, and the benchmark class should receive that path through initialization parameters or derive it from a caller-provided parent such as `datasets_dir`. Do not hide resource paths across multiple hardcoded locations.
- If a benchmark depends on external resources beyond Python packages, such as NLTK corpora/models, download them ahead of time into that benchmark resource root and have runtime code read from there. Do not rely on import-time auto-download behavior.
- `playground/eval/benchmarks/IFBench/benchmark.py` should lazy-import the official AllenAI verifier from `playground/eval/benchmarks/IFBench/official/` and derive its explicit resource root from the caller-provided simple-benchmark `datasets_dir`, using `<datasets_dir>/IFBENCH/` for `IFBench_test.jsonl` plus `nltk_data/`. `simple_eval` should pass that directory root directly, and the benchmark should only accept that directory-root form instead of carrying compatibility for explicit prompt-file paths. Do not keep a second hardcoded IFBench resource root in the benchmark or helper modules. Keep NLTK/resource setup lazy too; do not trigger imports, downloads, or directory creation at module import time. It defaults to official `loose` scoring and strips inline `<think>...</think>`-style reasoning before verification; rollout/sampling settings still come from `simple_eval`, so leaderboard parity still requires matching the official generation settings such as `temperature=0`.
- Keep IFBench benchmark-owned sampling overrides narrow. `playground/eval/benchmarks/IFBench/benchmark.py` should pin official settings like `temperature=0`, but should not hardcode `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs`; IFBench thinking/chat-template behavior should flow from `SimpleBenchmarksEvalConfig.chat_template_args`.
- For vendored official benchmark helpers such as `playground/eval/benchmarks/IFBench/official/`, keep only the runtime scoring path needed by the OSS benchmark wrapper. Script-style file I/O helpers, report printers, and other standalone-binary scaffolding from the upstream repo are dead weight unless the OSS call path actually invokes them.

## 6. Parallelism and Checkpointing

### Parallel state

- Global `PM` in `steptronoss.core.parallel_state` is the `ParallelManager`
- Typical flow:
  - `PM.initialize()`
  - `PM.set_mesh(parallel_cfg)`
  - or `with PM.use_mesh(parallel_cfg): ...`
- Common helpers:
  - `PM.define_parallel(pattern, **sizes)`
  - `PM.size_of("TP")`
  - `PM.rank_in("DP")`
  - `PM.group_of("PP")`
  - `PM.ranks_of("EP")`
- VPP uses:
  - `virtual_pipeline_model_parallel_size`
  - `get_vpp_rank()`
  - `set_vpp_rank()`
- `model_cfg.pipeline_activation_cpu_offload` applies to both `PPScheduler` and `VPPScheduler`; it is implemented with `torch.autograd.graph.save_on_cpu(...)`, currently requires `model_cfg.recompute=True`, and should be treated as graph-preserving activation offload rather than a replacement for `recompute`.

### EP / TP sizing

- `ParallelConfig.sanity_check()` requires:
  - `WORLD_SIZE` divisible by attention MP size = `PP * TP * CP`
  - `WORLD_SIZE` divisible by MoE MP size = `PP * ETP * EP`
- For an 8-GPU run with `TP=8` and `EP=8`, set:
  - `expert_tensor_parallel_size=1`
  - otherwise MoE MP size becomes 64 and the config is invalid
- In mixed dense/MoE topologies, expert params are reduced over `EDP`, not dense `DP`; the current gradient manager compensates with `TP/EP` scaling on expert grad buffers before the `EDP` reduction, so check that path before blaming an apparent extra `EP` factor.

### Checkpoint reshape

- `steptronoss/checkpointing/reshape_ops.py` contains reshape primitives:
  - `VocabPad`
  - `ColumnParallel` / `RowParallel`
  - `KeepThisTP` / `KeepThisEP`
  - `GQAMergeQKV`
  - `FFNMergeGateUp`
  - `UnbindMoE`
  - `Rename`
  - `Inverse`
- Typical usage:
  - build `Script(src=..., op=..., dst=...)`
  - return `OnlineReshaper(scripts)`
- For expert slicing from per-expert keys:
  - use `Inverse(UnbindMoE(...)) + KeepThisEP()` before TP ops

## 7. RLVR Priors

- `TrainableItem` should not pickle / serialize tokenizer instances; drop them in `__getstate__`
- `model_name` often includes `exp_id`; persist a template like `deployed-model-{EXP_ID}` so resume survives `exp_id` changes
- A temporary synthetic-latency harness was useful for proving that fully-async can outperform one-step-off in a balanced-base regime, but that experiment-only sleep code has been removed from the shared RLVR files. Keep future synthetic-latency instrumentation outside the main experiment code unless it is intended to stay.
- In `steptronoss/core/generators/flow_controller_simulator.py`, `max_concurrent` now means real concurrent prompt progress for every strategy: simple strategies use it as a per-block infer slot cap, and `fully-async` advances every running prompt each tick up to that cap.
- `steptronoss/core/generators/flow_controller_simulator.py` now applies `max_concurrent` consistently across strategies. For simple strategies, an explicit `max_concurrent` caps per-block infer concurrency; for `fully-async`, every running prompt advances each tick up to that concurrency cap (not the old single-prompt RR service bug).
- For short RLVR timing A/Bs (`train_iters` around 7), `fully-async` can look worse even when its simulator steady state is better, because the final drain/tail batch dominates the average. For flow-policy comparisons, prefer more iterations or compare middle steady-state steps separately from warmup/drain.
- `steptronoss/core/generators/flow_controller.py` runs rollout blocks sequentially on the inference side but can overlap the next block with trainer compute. Within a block, prompts are submitted concurrently and block duration is effectively bounded by the slowest prompt.
- `SimpleFlowController` version scheduling is `0, 1, 2, ...` for `on-policy` and `0, 0, 1, 2, ...` for `one-step-off`; after warm-up, `one-step-off` typically trains iter `k` on rollouts generated by actor version `k-1`.
- `FlowControllerConfig` is now the simple-controller base for `on-policy` / `one-step-off`, while `FullyAsyncFlowControllerConfig` carries `fully-async`-specific knobs (`max_untrained_prompts`, `max_staleness`) and dispatches to `FullyAsyncFlowController`. The current fully-async implementation is a first pass: it schedules prompts with backpressure, gates version bumps by staleness, and yields once `pre_train` has `prompt_per_iter` prompt results, but it should still be validated against the simulator before behavior-changing edits.
- `steptronoss/core/generators/flow_controller_simulator.py` is now the safest place to reason about new fully-async rollout rules first. Its `fully-async` path models `prompt_per_iter`, `max_untrained_prompts`, `max_staleness`, and an explicit `max_concurrent` concurrent-prompt scheduler before the real controller exists.

## 8. Optimization Guidance

### Muon

- Use `MuonConfig.mark_muon_params(model)` before grouping
- In experiments, prefer overriding `optimizer_cfg` via a `GradientManagerConfig` subclass that sets `optimizer_cfg = MuonConfig`
- Leave distributed optimizer on, but avoid byte-level sharding
- For Muon tests, prefer composing existing reshape ops instead of inventing new ones
- In `playground/sft/step3/*muon*`, `Step3p5MuonConfig.mark_muon_params` inlines the base Muon selection rules but tags trainable params with `ndim >= 2` as Muon candidates (still respecting embedding/name exclusions); Step3.5 Flash `GroupedExperts` merge ops use `UnbindMoE + Inverse(Column/RowParallel + KeepThisTP(group="ETP"))`.

### Triton workflow

- Follow:
  - `docs/TRITON_ACCELERATION_WORKFLOW.md`
  - `docs/TRITON_ACCELERATION_WORKFLOW_ZH.md`
- Rules:
  - optimized implementations belong under `steptronoss/model/optimizations/*`
  - semantic entrypoints stay in `steptronoss/model/utils/*`
  - expose alternatives through `@optimizable(...)`
  - alternatives must be strict drop-in replacements
  - add correctness tests, backward-aware benchmarks, and a short real experiment trace

## 9. Tests and Tooling

### Tooling notes

- `rg` may be unavailable; fall back to `find` / `grep`
- `python` may be missing and `python3` may not include `pytest`; prefer project tooling if available
- Some tensor-parallel model builders allocate on CUDA unconditionally; for CPU-only smoke tests around Step3.* multimodal `forward_head` / reshaper behavior, prefer a thin toy wrapper that reuses the real model methods with CPU-safe fake embeddings instead of building the full model.
- `tests/conftest.py` now applies a shared skip to every `@pytest.mark.node2` test unless the run is launched under `torchrun --nproc-per-node=2`; plain `pytest` should skip them instead of hanging in distributed init.

### GPU test notes

- This environment may not have worker / GPU access; avoid running GPU-only tests when the machine does not actually have GPUs
- `@pytest.mark.node2` tests should also use `pytest.mark.xdist_group("torchrun")`
- Test layout:
  - single-node GPU tests: `tests/test_muon_optimizer.py`
  - 2-node GPU tests: `tests/test_muon_optimizer_node2.py`
- `steptronoss/model/ep_dispatcher/deepep_dispatcher.py` must keep `recv_token_probs` differentiable and pass `grad_recv_token_probs` into `buffer.combine(...)`; otherwise router main-loss gradients are cut when `TokenDispatcher="deep_ep"`.

## 10. Debugging Priors

- `steptronoss.utils.memory_tracker.CMT` only records when `MEM_DIAGNOSE=1`
- If training hangs on `Waiting for debugger... ip: ... rank: 56`, check for a stray `debug(56)` in `steptronoss/core/trainers/lm_trainer.py`
- TorchDynamo graph breaks are often triggered by `Tensor.item()` in optimizable helpers; prefer tensor-safe checks like masked `amax` + `torch._assert`
- `steptronoss/model/common/rope.py` should keep RoPE cos/sin caches and cache-generation math in `torch.float32`; module-wide `.to()/cuda()/bfloat16()` may move the cache device, but must not downcast the cache dtype.
